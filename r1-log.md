# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Chris Hendrickson]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1st, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Laid out a plan, found courses on how to up my game across CSS, JS, and Bash. Got the Github up, practiced CSS and Bash.

### R1D2
Committed the practice Dojo files on Github for the now 2 days of JS and CSS practice exercises (https://github.com/ninjacom).

### R1D3
Learned how to make CSS changes via JS, and more about fraction units and repeat() in CSS Grid. Also learned about UI Elements in a Unity3D project. All on the Github (praise be to thee).

### R1D4
Had quite a workout with arrays in JS (map, sort, and reduce), and positioned items in CSS Grid using only numbers (no px, fr, or any other suffix).

### R1D5
Practiced JS changes to CSS Flexbox, and grid template areas in CSS Grid. Seems like CSS Grid is a bit more versatile than Flexbox and Bootstrap.
