# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Chris Hendrickson]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1st, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Laid out a plan, found courses on how to up my game across CSS, JS, and Bash. Got the Github up, practiced CSS and Bash.

### R1D2
Committed the practice Dojo files on Github for the now 2 days of JS and CSS practice exercises (https://github.com/ninjacom).

### R1D3
Learned how to make CSS changes via JS, and more about fraction units and repeat() in CSS Grid. Also learned about UI Elements in a Unity3D project. All on the Github (praise be to thee).

### R1D4
Had quite a workout with arrays in JS (map, sort, and reduce), and positioned items in CSS Grid using only numbers (no px, fr, or any other suffix).

### R1D5
Practiced JS changes to CSS Flexbox, and grid template areas in CSS Grid. Seems like CSS Grid is a bit more versatile than Flexbox and Bootstrap.

### R1D6
Completed the Ajax Type Ahead exersice in #js30. Also Day 6 for CSS Grid, and I started the Front End Developer Certificate on freeCodeCamp because why not?!

### R1D7
Completed the freeCodeCamp HTML5 and CSS section, and Day 7 for CSS Grid and Javascript30 (another Array Cardio day!). Also made a procedurally generated mobile game, using a Unity tutorial.

### R1D8
Completed Day 8 of #javascript30 and the @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast. Also got started on the #freeCodeCamp Responsive Design with Bootstrap section.

### R1D9
Day 9 of #javascript30 (browser console goodness) and the @scrima_com CSS Grid screencast (named lines). Also hammering away at #freeCodeCamp Responsive Design with Bootstrap.

### R1D10
Day 10 of #javascript30 (hold shift to select many checkboxes) and @scrima_com CSS Grid screencast (justify-content and align-content). In #freeCodeCamp I've progressed to jQuery!

### R1D11
Missed yesterday with traveling, woops! Today I finished the jQuery section of #freeCodeCamp, and now working on the Tribute Page project via #CodePen.

### R1D12
Working on the first #freeCodeCamp project, the Tribute Page, via #CodePen.

### R1D13
Day 11 of #javascript30 (custom HTML5 video player). Finished the Tribute page in #freeCodeCamp, and now working on the Personal Portfolio page via #CodePen.
