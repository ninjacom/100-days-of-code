# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Took the challenge, setup the GitHub repo, found courses for learning CSS Grid and Vanilla JS, also found a tutorial for Bash. Started practicing CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I feel very rusty with all things Developer-y, and it's time to get back into fit form. Just like with a foreign language, first comes the reading and listening, then the writing and speaking. CSS Grid looks great, and feels like a nice soft reentry into code literacy.

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up and practiced Bash on PC Laptop (Required Ubuntu. also installed Atom), used Enki to learn more about Linux, watched first Vanilla JS video.

**Thoughts**: I stretched out of my comfort zone with all the command line today. Not sure if I actually spend 1 hour coding, today felt like a lot of setup and prep. Watching 20 mins of rapid JS felt like the first time doing a 7 minute workout after weeks of lounging around.

### Day 2: January 3rd, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up the Github repo for my JS and CSS practice, called Dojo. Committed first 2 days of vanilla JS projects, which are a Drum Kit and animated analog Clock.

**Thoughts** Forgot how fun it is to spot typo's in non-working code - today it was transitionend (instead of the incorrect transitioned). Feeling more confident in the code, making changes live in Chrome browser and copy/pasta into Brackets. Coding is getting addictive!
