# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Took the challenge, setup the GitHub repo, found courses for learning CSS Grid and Vanilla JS, also found a tutorial for Bash. Started practicing CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I feel very rusty with all things Developer-y, and it's time to get back into fit form. Just like with a foreign language, first comes the reading and listening, then the writing and speaking. CSS Grid looks great, and feels like a nice soft reentry into code literacy.

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up and practiced Bash on PC Laptop (Required Ubuntu. also installed Atom), used Enki to learn more about Linux, watched first Vanilla JS video.

**Thoughts**: I stretched out of my comfort zone with all the command line today. Not sure if I actually spend 1 hour coding, today felt like a lot of setup and prep. Watching 20 mins of rapid JS felt like the first time doing a 7 minute workout after weeks of lounging around.

### Day 2: January 3rd, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up the Github repo for my JS and CSS practice, called Dojo. Committed first 2 days of vanilla JS projects, which are a Drum Kit and animated analog Clock.

**Thoughts** Forgot how fun it is to spot typo's in non-working code - today it was transitionend (instead of the incorrect transitioned). Feeling more confident in the code, making changes live in Chrome browser and copy/pasta into Brackets. Coding is getting addictive!

### Day 3: January 4th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed practice exercises in CSS Grid (Day 3) and JS (Day 3) Specifically, I learned how to make CSS changes via JS, and more about responsive positioning with fractional units in CSS Grid. Also implemented many UI Elements in a Unity3D project called Clicker Game. 

**Thoughts** Lots of new stuff to learn, I hope it all stays in my head. Actually, I hope I remember all this in the moments that I need them. I suppose that's why this is a daily practice, using straight repetition to memorize and recite what I need when I need it.

### Day 4: January 5th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed practice exercise in CSS Grid (Day 4) and JS fundamentals (Day 4). Had quite a workout with arrays in JS (map, sort, and reduce), and positioned items in CSS Grid using only numbers (no px, fr, or any other suffix).

**Thoughts** 
Whew! That was an exhausting workout, lots learned. I will have to practice these basics again to really cement them into my brain. I'm also not sure that front end dev only should be my focus. Along with more Unity (C#), I should pivot soon to include more full-stack work (SQL).
