# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Took the challenge, setup the GitHub repo, found courses for learning CSS Grid and Vanilla JS, also found a tutorial for Bash. Started practicing CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I feel very rusty with all things Developer-y, and it's time to get back into fit form. Just like with a foreign language, first comes the reading and listening, then the writing and speaking. CSS Grid looks great, and feels like a nice soft reentry into code literacy.

### Day 1: January 3rd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up and practiced Bash on PC Laptop (Required Ubuntu. also installed Atom), used Enki to learn more about Linux, watched first Vanilla JS video.

**Thoughts**: I stretched out of my comfort zone with all the command line today. Not sure if I actually spend 1 hour coding, today felt like a lot of setup and prep. Watching 20 mins of rapid JS felt like the first time doing a 7 minute workout after weeks of lounging around.

### Day 2: January 4th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up the Github repo for my JS and CSS practice, called Dojo. Committed first 2 days of vanilla JS projects, which are a Drum Kit and animated analog Clock.

**Thoughts** Forgot how fun it is to spot typo's in non-working code - today it was transitionend (instead of the incorrect transitioned). Feeling more confident in the code, making changes live in Chrome browser and copy/pasta into Brackets. Coding is getting addictive!

### Day 3: January 5th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed practice exercises in CSS Grid (Day 3) and JS (Day 3) Specifically, I learned how to make CSS changes via JS, and more about responsive positioning with fractional units in CSS Grid. Also implemented many UI Elements in a Unity3D project called Clicker Game. 

**Thoughts** Lots of new stuff to learn, I hope it all stays in my head. Actually, I hope I remember all this in the moments that I need them. I suppose that's why this is a daily practice, using straight repetition to memorize and recite what I need when I need it.

### Day 4: January 6th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed practice exercise in CSS Grid (Day 4) and JS fundamentals (Day 4). Had quite a workout with arrays in JS (map, sort, and reduce), and positioned items in CSS Grid using only numbers (no px, fr, or any other suffix).

**Thoughts** 
Whew! That was an exhausting workout, lots learned. I will have to practice these basics again to really cement them into my brain. I'm also not sure that front end dev only should be my focus. Along with more Unity (C#), I should pivot soon to include more full-stack work (SQL).

### Day 5: January 7th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS changes to CSS Flexbox, and grid template areas in CSS Grid (both Day 5).

**Thoughts** 
Seems like CSS Grid is a bit better than Flexbox, and I already heard it's a bit better than using Bootstrap. Will keep these in mind.

### Day 6: January 8th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Ajax Type Ahead exersice in #js30. Also Day 6 for CSS Grid, and I started the Front End Developer Certificate on freeCodeCamp because why not?!

**Thoughts** Pretty cool to make an autocomplete box, it's not too difficult! I think I made something like this before for NomadPass 2 years ago, except the code was probably spaghetti. It feels good to have a bigger goal in sight with the Front End Dev Certificate, glad I decided to go for that even though its 482 hours. I'd ultimately like to finish all their certifications and do the job training section they offer... it will take over 1,323 hours and 3 certifications to get there though!

### Day 7: January 9th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp HTML5 and CSS section, and Day 7 for CSS Grid and Javascript30 (another Array Cardio day!). Also made a procedurally generated mobile game, using a Unity tutorial.

**Thoughts** I thought it would take longer (5 hours) to complete the freeCodeCamp section, I guess it helps that I already knew what I was working through. The Array Cardio Day wasn't too crazy this time, learned some helpful methods.

### Day 8: January 10th, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 8 of #javascript30 and the @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast. Also got started on the #freeCodeCamp Responsive Design with Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts** 
HTML5 Canvas is pretty cool, could use that to make 2D or 3D games. And CSS Grid's ability to fit all the images no matter their differing sizes is really neat! It feels backwards to be doing Bootstrap now.. eh I'll just power through it quickly, and use it as a case study comparing the past and the future of CSS.

### Day 9: January 11th, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Day 9 of #javascript30 (browser console goodness) and the @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast (named lines). Also hammering away at #freeCodeCamp Responsive Design with Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** 
I actually learned a lot about how to print stuff with the browser console, and how to do a bit better job of bug tracking. Cool to see that CSS Grid lets you programmatically style the HTML.

### Day 10: January 12th, Friday
Day 10 of #javascript30 (hold shift to select many checkboxes) and @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast (justify-content and align-content). In #freeCodeCamp I've progressed on to jQuery.

**Thoughts** 
It's funny (and sad) that my once sharp coding brain couldn't really find a good solution by myself for the Hold Shift to Select Many Checkboxes. By myself, I draw a blank. However, I am able to keep up with what is being said and it all makes sense AFTER I hear it. Also, I didn't know that justify-content is for rows, and align-content for columns.

### Day 11: January 14th, Sunday
Working on the first #freeCodeCamp project, the Tribute Page, via #CodePen.

**Thoughts** 
I fell behind quite a bit, lost some momuentum. Hard to keep habits of mind when traveling / adapting to changing current circumstances.

### Day 12: January 17th, Wednesday
Finished the jQuery section of #freeCodeCamp, and now working on the Tribute Page via #CodePen.

**Thoughts** 
I fell behind by missing a day, due to travels and being out of the normal flow of things. Will have to keep this in mind for the future.

### Day 13: January 21th, Sunday
Day 11 of #javascript30 (custom HTML5 video player). Finished the Tribute page in #freeCodeCamp, and now working on the Personal Portfolio page via #CodePen.

**Thoughts** 
It's really hard to pick up again after losing momentum. Hoping that the next 3 weeks here in London will help with my coding consistency. Brainfog is difficult to combat with these lost days adding to the inertia.

### Day 14: January 22th, Monday
Day 12 of #javascript30 (key sequence detection), played with more of the bonus content of the @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast, and started the #freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio page via #CodePen.

**Thoughts** 
I feel back in the flow of coding, though I feel the need to augment my studies with some higher level, interview-style questions and studies. More algorithms, design patterns, and whiteboard coding tests.

### Day 15: January 23th, Tuesday
Day 13 of #javascript30 (slide in on scroll), and watched the LAST of the bonus content of the @scrimba_com CSS Grid screencast. Also learning animations and tweens in Unity3D.

**Thoughts** 
I think I'm going to challenge myself to do the freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio page using CSS Grid and Flexbox - they are the future, not Bootstrap.

### Day 16: January 24th, Wednesday
Day 14 of #javascript30 (JS References vs. Copying), and worked on my #freeCodeCamp Portfolio page on my local machine.

**Thoughts** 
Despite having completed the CSS grid screencast, I don't feel like I've remembered enough to 'speak' it when needed. I guess it may be worth taking Wes Bos's CSS Grid course too!
